Meeting 1:
Suggests putting a column in between backlog and progress that is labeled "things to get done this week" so it's not all just in backlog

Go through and make sure everyone is assigned at least one task for this week 
  Next meeting make sure that's done in advance 

Suggestion for the use case diagram: have more "users" and adjust it so we have at least two types, such as,
  - are or aren't log in
  - New customers and returning, 
  - etc.
^This will help with knowing what routes to take for the different scenarios 

Release Notes: got to github and create tags (instructions in project guide). If you have issues it will convert them into release notes
